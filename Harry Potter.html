    <h1>Obscure Harry Potter Facts</h1>
    <p>Because even the Room of Requirement has secrets...</p>
  </header>

  <div class="fact"><h2>1. Snape Invented Spells as a Teenager</h2><p>In school, Snape created spells like Sectumsempra, Levicorpus, and Muffliato—and even annotated his Potions book better than the textbook. He didn’t just follow magic… he mastered it young.</p></div>

  <div class="fact"><h2>2. Hermione Was Almost in Ravenclaw</h2><p>The Sorting Hat took nearly four minutes choosing between Ravenclaw and Gryffindor. That’s called a Hatstall. It picked Gryffindor in the end, not because of smarts, but because she was brave enough to put friendship first.</p></div>

  <div class="fact"><h2>3. Hagrid Still Uses His Broken Wand</h2><p>Hagrid’s wand was snapped when he was expelled. But he hid the pieces in his pink umbrella and still uses them—even though he’s technically not allowed to perform magic.</p></div>

  <div class="fact"><h2>4. Trelawney’s Weirdest Predictions Were Real</h2><p>Everyone mocks Professor Trelawney, but she made two real prophecies: one about Harry and Voldemort, and another about the Dark Lord's servant returning. She doesn’t know when she’s accurate—but when she is, it’s dead on.</p></div>

  <div class="fact"><h2>5. Dumbledore’s Name Has Hidden Meaning</h2><p>His full name — Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore — isn’t just a mouthful. “Albus” means white, “Wulfric” is a legendary saint, and “Brian” grounds him. It’s a blend of greatness and humility.</p></div>

  <div class="fact"><h2>6. Ron Faced the Darkest Horcrux</h2><p>The locket Horcrux attacked Ron’s deepest fears—his jealousy, his insecurity, his fear of being second-best. But he still destroyed it. A moment that showed just how strong he really was.</p></div>

  <div class="fact"><h2>7. Crookshanks Isn’t Just a Grumpy Cat</h2><p>Crookshanks is actually half-Kneazle, a magical creature known for sensing untrustworthy people. That’s why he instantly disliked Scabbers—because Scabbers was actually Peter Pettigrew.</p></div>

  <div class="fact"><h2>8. The Whomping Willow Hid a Secret for Years</h2><p>It wasn’t just a violent tree. The Whomping Willow was planted to protect Remus Lupin’s secret. It hid a tunnel to the Shrieking Shack, where he transformed into a werewolf in secret.</p></div>

  <div class="fact"><h2>9. The Marauders Map Could Outsmart Everyone</h2><p>The map shows every person at Hogwarts, including Animagi, ghosts, and people under Invisibility Cloaks. It once showed Peter Pettigrew, who everyone believed was dead.</p></div>

  <div class="fact"><h2>10. Brooms Used to Be Extremely Uncomfortable</h2><p>Flying brooms weren’t always slick. Before the Cushioning Charm was invented in the 1800s, brooms were stiff, rough, and dangerous. Flying was literally a pain in the butt.</p></div>

  <div class="fact"><h2>11. Hogwarts Toilets Flush into the Black Lake</h2><p>All Hogwarts waste magically flows into the Black Lake. That means... yes, toilets, ghosts, and mermaids all share the same waters. You're never looking at the lake the same way again.</p></div>

  <div class="fact"><h2>12. Arthur Weasley Was Bitten by a Horcrux</h2><p>In Order of the Phoenix, Arthur was bitten by Nagini, Voldemort’s pet snake—and later, a Horcrux. Harry only saw it happen because he was connected to Voldemort’s mind.</p></div>

  <div class="fact"><h2>13. Peeves Isn’t a Ghost — He’s a Poltergeist</h2><p>Peeves wasn’t ever alive. He’s a poltergeist, a creature formed from centuries of Hogwarts student mischief. He doesn’t follow rules because he was born from breaking them.</p></div>

  <div class="fact"><h2>14. The Mirror of Erised Can Drive You Mad</h2><p>The Mirror doesn’t protect you—it tempts you. Dumbledore said people have “wasted away” in front of it. It doesn’t show what’s real. It shows what you desperately want.</p></div>

  <div class="fact"><h2>15. Professor McGonagall Was a Quidditch Star</h2><p>She played as a student and was injured in a brutal match. That’s why she gets so fired up watching Gryffindor play—she remembers what it was like to fly.</p></div>

  <div class="fact"><h2>16. The Potters Descended from a Famous Healer</h2><p>Harry’s ancestor, Linfred of Stinchcombe, invented several healing potions still used today, including Skele-Gro. That’s how the Potters got their fortune—not from Gringotts goblins, but hard work and medicine.</p></div>

  <div class="fact"><h2>17. Dumbledore’s Scar Was a London Subway Map</h2><p>In a small fun detail J.K. Rowling once shared, Dumbledore had a scar shaped like the London Underground map on his knee. She never explained why, and maybe she never will.</p></div>

  <div class="fact"><h2>18. Charlie Weasley Helped Smuggle a Dragon</h2><p>Charlie didn’t just study dragons—he helped smuggle one into Hogwarts during the Triwizard Tournament. The Hungarian Horntail Harry fought? Charlie helped bring it in.</p></div>

  <div class="fact"><h2>19. The Ministry of Magic Uses Fake Weather</h2><p>The Ministry is underground, but its windows show fake weather. Want sunshine? The Magical Maintenance department can change it. Bad weather usually means they're negotiating better pay.</p></div>

  <div class="fact"><h2>20. You Can’t Summon Food</h2><p>No matter how good you are at magic, you can’t conjure food out of thin air. It’s one of the five principal exceptions to Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfiguration. That’s why house-elves are still essential to Hogwarts.</p></div>
